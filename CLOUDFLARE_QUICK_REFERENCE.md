## Important URLs to Keep

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Cloudflare Dashboard | https://dash.cloudflare.com |
| Your Worker | https://dash.cloudflare.com â†’ Workers & Pages â†’ mapit-api |
| Worker Live URL | https://mapit-api.YOUR-ACCOUNT.workers.dev |
| Your App | https://mapit.optimalservers.online |

---

## File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/Users/toufic/mapit/.env` | Frontend config (update VITE_API_URL here) |
| `/Users/toufic/mapit/dist/` | Built frontend (upload to server) |
| Cloudflare Worker Editor | Your backend code (paste code here) |

---

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### "DATABASE_URL not set"
â†’ Check Settings â†’ Variables â†’ Verify DATABASE_URL is there

### "Invalid email or password" when creating user
â†’ This is GOOD! Means database is connected, just no user exists yet

### Worker shows 404
â†’ Check code was pasted correctly, click "Save and Deploy"

### Frontend still getting errors
â†’ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete), check VITE_API_URL in .env

## Next Steps (After Deployment)

1. **Add more endpoints** - Copy existing endpoint pattern
2. **Add error logging** - Use Cloudflare Logs
3. **Monitor performance** - View in Cloudflare Analytics
4. **Scale globally** - Cloudflare auto-handles this
5. **Add custom domain** - Later: set up yourdomain.com with Cloudflare
