# âœ… SPA Routing Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem
When accessing the map viewing page at `https://mapit-....vercel.app/view-map/13`, you were getting a white page with the error:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"
```

## Root Cause
This is a common Single Page Application (SPA) routing issue on Vercel. When you navigate to a URL like `/view-map/13`, the server was not properly handling the rewrite to `index.html`, causing the browser to request JavaScript assets with the wrong MIME type.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `vercel.json` 
**Changed the rewrite rule** to properly handle SPA routing:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/index.html",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key changes:**
- âœ… Better regex pattern to exclude `/api` routes
- âœ… Excludes static assets properly
- âœ… Added cache headers for `index.html` (prevents caching issues)
- âœ… Added MIME type header to prevent type confusion

### 2. Updated `vite.config.ts`
**Added explicit SPA configuration:**

```typescript
// For SPA routing to work - ensure all routes serve index.html
appType: 'spa',
base: '/'
```

**Key changes:**
- âœ… Changed `base` from `'./'` to `'/'` (absolute path better for Vercel)
- âœ… Added `appType: 'spa'` to explicitly tell Vite this is a single-page app

## What Happens Now

1. **User visits:** `https://mapit-....vercel.app/view-map/13`
2. **Vercel rewrites to:** `/index.html`
3. **Browser receives:** The main HTML file with proper MIME type
4. **React Router handles:** The routing to show the map page
5. **Map loads:** Successfully without white page error âœ…

## Deployment Process

Your changes have been pushed to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

**Vercel will automatically:**
1. Detect the new commits
2. Rebuild the application with the updated config
3. Deploy the new version
4. Changes should be live within 2-5 minutes

## Testing

After deployment, test these URLs:

âœ… **Landing page:**
```
https://mapit-....vercel.app/
https://mapit-....vercel.app/login
https://mapit-....vercel.app/register
```

âœ… **Map viewing:**
```
https://mapit-....vercel.app/view-map/13
https://mapit-....vercel.app/view-map/1
```

âœ… **Admin dashboard:**
```
https://mapit-....vercel.app/admin/dashboard
https://mapit-....vercel.app/admin/packages
```

âœ… **API endpoints (should still work):**
```
https://mapit-....vercel.app/api/login
https://mapit-....vercel.app/api/map/13
https://mapit-....vercel.app/api/map/13/zones
```

## How React Router Routes Work

Your `App.tsx` defines the routes:
```tsx
<Route path="/view-map/:id" element={<MapPageWithSidebar />} />
```

Now when users visit `/view-map/13`:
1. Vercel rewrites it to `index.html`
2. React Router's BrowserRouter reads the URL
3. It matches the route and renders `<MapPageWithSidebar />`
4. Component loads the map data using the ID from the URL

## Common SPA Routes You Can Now Access

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Home/Dashboard |
| `/login` | Customer login |
| `/register` | Customer registration |
| `/dashboard` | Customer map dashboard |
| `/create-map` | Create new map |
| `/view-map/:id` | View public map (fixed âœ…) |
| `/edit-map/:id` | Edit map (for owner) |
| `/upgrade` | Upgrade account |
| `/admin/dashboard` | Admin panel |
| `/admin/packages` | Manage packages |
| `/admin/orders` | View orders |

## If Issues Persist

1. **Hard refresh browser:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache:** In DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Clear Storage
3. **Check Vercel logs:** Go to Vercel dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ View logs
4. **Verify environment variables:** Check that `DATABASE_URL` is still set in Vercel

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed:** SPA routing on Vercel  
âœ… **Cause:** Incorrect rewrite rules for client-side routing  
âœ… **Solution:** Updated `vercel.json` and `vite.config.ts`  
âœ… **Deployed:** Changes pushed to main branch  
âœ… **Status:** Vercel will auto-deploy within minutes  

Your `/view-map/13` page should now load correctly! ðŸŽ‰
