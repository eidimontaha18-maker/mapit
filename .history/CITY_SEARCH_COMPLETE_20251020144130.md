## üîß How It Works

### 3-Tier System:

1. **Comprehensive Database** (60+ countries)
   - Pre-loaded major cities
   - Instant display, no API calls
   - 100% accurate and country-specific

2. **Manual Mapping** (Countries with 5+ local cities)
   - Uses local city data
   - Fast, no network requests
   - Country-specific filtering

3. **API Fetching** (Countries not in database)
   - Nominatim API with `country=` parameter
   - Overpass API with ISO country codes
   - Strict country boundaries, no proximity fallback

### Country-Specific Guarantees:

‚úÖ **All cities belong to the searched country**
‚úÖ **No neighboring country cities**
‚úÖ **No proximity-based searches**
‚úÖ **API queries use country codes and ISO codes**

## üéØ Testing

To verify the feature is working:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Search for any country
3. Check console for:
   ```
   üîç Fetching cities for: [Country Name]
   ‚úÖ Found X major cities for [Country Name] in database: [City1, City2, ...]
   ```
4. Verify all displayed cities belong to that country

## üìù Console Logs

The system provides detailed logging:

- `üîç Fetching cities for: X` - Started fetching for country X
- `‚úÖ Found X major cities in database: [names]` - Using pre-loaded data
- `‚úÖ Using X local cities: [names]` - Using manual mapping
- `üåê Fetching from APIs...` - Querying external APIs
