## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Open Create Map page
- [ ] Verify map code appears immediately
- [ ] Draw 2-3 test zones
- [ ] Check zones appear in "Created Zones" list
- [ ] Verify zones show "Pending" status
- [ ] Check save button shows zone count
- [ ] Click save button
- [ ] Verify loading state appears
- [ ] Check success message shows correct count
- [ ] Verify redirect to dashboard after 2 seconds
- [ ] Check map appears in dashboard with zones

### Database Verification
- [ ] Query map table for new record
- [ ] Verify map_code is stored
- [ ] Query zones table for zone records
- [ ] Verify map_id matches created map
- [ ] Check customer_id is set correctly
- [ ] Verify coordinates are stored as JSONB
- [ ] Check timestamps are populated

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with 0 zones (map only)
- [ ] Test with 10+ zones
- [ ] Test with very long zone names
- [ ] Test with special characters in names
- [ ] Test network failure during save
- [ ] Test duplicate zone creation
- [ ] Test rapid clicking of save button

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome/Edge
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Backend
- [x] server.js running on port 3101
- [x] Database connection configured
- [x] Map creation endpoint working
- [x] Zone creation endpoint working
- [x] CORS configured for frontend

### Frontend
- [x] Vite dev server running
- [x] CreateMapPage.tsx updated
- [x] API endpoints configured
- [x] React Router navigation working
- [x] State management implemented

### Database
- [x] zones table exists with correct schema
- [x] map table has map_code column
- [x] Foreign key relationships set up
- [x] Indexes created for performance
- [x] Customer ownership tracked

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Target Benchmarks
- Map code generation: < 10ms
- Zone display update: < 50ms

- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Map ownership validated
- [x] Zone ownership linked to customer

## 📱 Accessibility

- [x] Semantic HTML structure
- [x] Proper heading hierarchy
- [x] Color contrast ratios met
- [x] Keyboard navigation support
- [x] Screen reader friendly labels
- [x] Focus states visible
- [x] Error messages announced

## 🎨 Design Consistency

## 📞 Support Information

### If Issues Occur

1. **Check Servers**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   node server.js
   
   # Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify Database**
   ```bash
   node test-postgres-connection.js
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check network tab for failed requests
   - Verify API responses

4. **Review Logs**
   - Backend console output
   - Database query logs
   - Network request/response data

### Common Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Map code not showing | Check useEffect hook execution |
| Zones not appearing | Verify handleZoneCreated callback |
| Save button disabled | Check isSaving state reset |
| Database not saving | Verify connection string |
| Redirect not working | Check navigate function |
| Zones showing wrong status | Verify savedZones state update |
