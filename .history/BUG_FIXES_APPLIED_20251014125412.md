# Bug Fixes Applied - October 14, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/db/tables/map?customer_id=18`
**Problem:** Database queries were failing due to missing `query` method in dbOperations export.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `query` method to `src/db/dbOperations.js`
- This method acts as a convenience wrapper for `pool.query()`
- Updated default export to include the `query` method

**File Modified:** `src/db/dbOperations.js`

```javascript
// Added query method
export async function query(sql, params) {
  return await pool.query(sql, params);
}

export default {
  pool,
  query,  // ← Added this
  // ... other methods
};
```

---

### 2. ❌ 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/login`
**Problem:** Same root cause - missing query method.

**Fix:** Same as above - the query method fix resolves both issues.

---

### 3. ⚠️ CORS Issues with Vite Dev Server Ports
**Problem:** Vite was using ports 5175, 5176 which weren't in the CORS whitelist.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added ports 5175 and 5176 to CORS configuration in `server.js`

**File Modified:** `server.js`

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:8080',
    'http://127.0.0.1:8080',
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'http://127.0.0.1:5173',
    'http://localhost:5174',
    'http://127.0.0.1:5174',
    'http://localhost:5175',    // ← Added
    'http://127.0.0.1:5175',    // ← Added
    'http://localhost:5176',    // ← Added
    'http://127.0.0.1:5176'     // ← Added
  ],
  // ... rest of config
}));
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/db/dbOperations.js**
   - Added `query()` method
   - Updated default export

2. **server.js**
   - Added CORS origins for ports 5175, 5176

3. **test-server-simple.js** (Created)
   - Simple test server for debugging
   - Can be used to verify backend is working

---

## Testing

### ✅ Backend Server
```bash
# Server is now running successfully
node server.js

# Expected output:
PostgreSQL connection successful
Starting server on port 3101 (127.0.0.1)...
✅ SUCCESS: API server running on http://127.0.0.1:3101
```

### ✅ API Endpoints
All endpoints should now work:
- `GET /api/db/tables/map?customer_id=X` - Fetch user maps
- `POST /api/login` - User login
- `POST /api/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

### ✅ Frontend
- Refresh your browser (Ctrl + F5 or Cmd + Shift + R)
- Login should now work
- Dashboard should load maps
- No more 500 errors

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that `db-routes.js` was calling `db.pool.query()` and `db.query()`, but the `dbOperations.js` module didn't export a `query` method in its default export.

While `pool` was exported, using `db.pool.query()` worked, but some places in the code tried to use `db.query()` which didn't exist.

Adding the `query` method to the default export ensures both patterns work.

---

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:

1. **Always export all commonly used methods** in module default exports
2. **Use TypeScript** for better type checking (would have caught this)
3. **Add integration tests** for API endpoints
4. **Monitor server logs** during development

---

## Status: ✅ FIXED

All 500 errors should now be resolved. The application should work normally.

### Next Steps:
1. Refresh your browser
2. Try logging in
3. Check dashboard loads maps
4. Test creating new maps
5. Verify zones save correctly

If you still see errors, check:
- Server is running (`node server.js`)
- Vite is running (`npm run dev`)
- Browser console for any new errors
- Server terminal for error logs
