# üêõ ZONE SAVING & MAP CODE ISSUES - DEBUGGING

## Issues Reported:
1. ‚ùå Zones disappear after drawing and saving
2. ‚ùå Map code not shown in the new maps

## Current State (from database check):
- Map 13 "edwef" created with code `MAP-2BHE-OA65` has **0 zones**
- Map 12 "fff" has 2 zones ‚úÖ
- Map 10 "map1" has 8 zones ‚úÖ

## Code Flow Analysis:

### When User Draws a Zone:
1. User draws polygon on WorldMap
2. `WorldMap.handleZoneCreated()` is called
3. Zone is passed to `CreateMapPage.handleZoneCreated()` via `onZoneCreated` prop
4. Zone is added to `pendingZones` state array
5. `hasUnsavedChanges` is set to true

### When User Clicks "Save Map":
1. `CreateMapPage.handleSave()` is called
2. Map data is saved via `POST /api/map`
3. Backend returns `{ success: true, map: { map_id: X, ...} }`
4. `savePendingZones(map_id, customer_id)` is called
5. For each zone in `pendingZones`:
   - `POST /api/zone` with { map_id, customer_id, name, color, coordinates }
   - Backend generates UUID and inserts to database
6. Page redirects to dashboard after 2 seconds

## Potential Problems:

### Problem 1: Zones State Loss
**Hypothesis:** `pendingZones` might be empty when `handleSave` is called
**Possible Causes:**
- State update timing (React batching)
- Component re-render clearing state
- Zone not being added to state properly

**Solution:** Added logging to track:
- When zones are added to pendingZones
- Count of pendingZones at save time

### Problem 2: Map Code Not Displayed
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
The map code IS being displayed in the UI at lines 650-670 of CreateMapPage.tsx:
```tsx
{mapCode && (
  <div style={{ ... }}>
    <span>Map Code:</span>
    <div>{mapCode}</div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Note:** Map code IS generated and displayed. User might be looking at dashboard where map codes are NOT shown in the table.

## Dashboard Display Issue:
Looking at the screenshot, the dashboard shows:
- Map ID
- Title  
- Description
- Zones count
- Created At
- Actions

**Missing:** Map Code column!

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Added Debug Logging to CreateMapPage.tsx ‚úÖ
- Log pending zones when save is clicked
- Log when zones are added to pendingZones
- Log count after each zone addition

### 2. Need to Add Map Code to Dashboard Table
The dashboard needs to show the map_code column!

## Next Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Test zone creation with browser console open
2. ‚úÖ Check if pendingZones is populated
3. ‚ùå Add map_code column to Dashboard table
4. ‚ùå Test complete flow: Create map ‚Üí Draw zones ‚Üí Save ‚Üí View in dashboard
