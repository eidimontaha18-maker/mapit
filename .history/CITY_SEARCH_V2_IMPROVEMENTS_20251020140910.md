## 🎨 Visual Features

### City List Header
```
📍 Cities in Lebanon (5)
     ↑              ↑
   Icon      City count
```

### Search Box (appears when > 3 cities)
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Search cities...        [×] │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Filtered Results
```
Typing "Tri" shows:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Tripoli              🔍+    │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Typing "xyz" shows:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ No cities found matching    │
│ "xyz"                       │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### City-to-Country Mapping
Created a new file: `src/utils/cityToCountry.ts`

```typescript
export const CITY_TO_COUNTRY: Record<string, string> = {
  // Lebanon
  'Beirut': 'Lebanon',
  'Tripoli': 'Lebanon',
  'Sidon': 'Lebanon',
  'Tyre': 'Lebanon',
  'Baalbek': 'Lebanon',
  
  // Syria
  'Damascus': 'Syria',
  'Aleppo': 'Syria',
  // ... more cities
};
```

### New Filtering Logic
```typescript
// Old approach (distance-based)
if (distance <= 500km) {
  cities.push(city); // Could include neighboring countries
}

// New approach (country-based)
if (CITY_TO_COUNTRY[cityName] === selectedCountry) {
  cities.push(city); // Only cities from selected country
}
```

### Search Filtering
```typescript
// Filter cities by search term
countryCities
  .filter(city => 
    city.name.toLowerCase().includes(citySearchTerm.toLowerCase())
  )
  .map(city => /* render city button */)
```

### Zoom Levels Summary
```
World View:     2  (continents)
Country View:  10  (detailed regions) ⬆️ INCREASED
City View:     13  (street level) ⬆️ INCREASED
```
