# Viewport-Based City Filtering Implementation

## Summary
Implemented smart city filtering that displays only cities visible in the current map viewport. When you search for a country and zoom in, the cities list now automatically updates to show only the cities you can see on the map.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Viewport Filtering** üó∫Ô∏è
- Cities are filtered in real-time based on the map's visible bounds
- As you zoom in/out or pan the map, the cities list automatically updates
- Shows count of visible cities vs total cities (e.g., "Cities in United States (25 in view)")

### 2. **7x Automatic Zoom** üîç
- Updated from 5x to 7x zoom multiplier as requested
- **Zoom levels now:**
  - Small countries (Lebanon, Kuwait): 8 ‚Üí **56**
  - Medium countries (Syria, Jordan): 6-7 ‚Üí **42-49**
  - Large countries (USA, Canada): 3-4 ‚Üí **21-28**

### 3. **Smart City Boundaries** üéØ
- Enhanced validation ensures cities belong to the searched country
- Filters out cities from neighboring countries
- Uses multiple API sources for comprehensive coverage

### 4. **Real-time Updates** ‚ö°
- Map bounds update on every zoom/pan action
- Cities list refreshes instantly when viewport changes
- Efficient filtering using React.useMemo for performance

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. **CountrySidebar.tsx**
- Added `mapBounds` prop to receive viewport boundaries
- Implemented `visibleCities` using React.useMemo for efficient filtering
- Updated city display to show only cities within viewport
- Enhanced UI to show "X in view" when bounds filtering is active

```typescript
// Filter cities based on map viewport bounds
const visibleCities = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (!mapBounds || countryCities.length === 0) {
    return countryCities;
  }

  const filtered = countryCities.filter(city => {
    return city.lat >= mapBounds.south &&
           city.lat <= mapBounds.north &&
           city.lng >= mapBounds.west &&
           city.lng <= mapBounds.east;
  });

  return filtered;
}, [mapBounds, countryCities]);
```

#### 2. **WorldMap.tsx**
- Added `onBoundsChange` prop to WorldMapProps interface
- Created `BoundsTracker` component to monitor map viewport
- Tracks map movements with `moveend` and `zoomend` events
- Passes bounds to parent component in real-time

```typescript
// Component to track map bounds
const BoundsTracker = ({ onBoundsChange }) => {
  const map = useMap();

  useEffect(() => {
    const updateBounds = () => {
      const bounds = map.getBounds();
      onBoundsChange({
        north: bounds.getNorth(),
        south: bounds.getSouth(),
        east: bounds.getEast(),
        west: bounds.getWest()
      });
    };

    updateBounds(); // Initial
    map.on('moveend', updateBounds);
    map.on('zoomend', updateBounds);

    return () => {
      map.off('moveend', updateBounds);
      map.off('zoomend', updateBounds);
    };
  }, [map, onBoundsChange]);

  return null;
};
```

#### 3. **CreateMapPage.tsx**
- Added `mapBounds` state to store current viewport
- Connected WorldMap's `onBoundsChange` to state updater
- Passed bounds to CountrySidebar component

## User Experience Flow

### Example: Searching for "United States"

1. **User types "United States" and clicks search**
   - Map zooms to USA with 7x multiplier (zoom level 21)
   - Initial viewport might show entire USA

2. **Cities list updates automatically**
   - Shows: "Cities in United States (47 in view)"
   - Displays only cities visible in current viewport

3. **User zooms into California**
   - Cities list automatically updates
   - Now shows: "Cities in United States (12 in view)"
   - Only California cities are displayed

4. **User pans to Texas**
   - Cities list refreshes instantly
   - Shows Texas cities only
   - Count updates automatically

5. **User zooms out to see full USA**
   - More cities appear in the list
   - Count increases: "(89 in view)"

## Benefits

### For Users üë•
- **Less overwhelming**: Only see relevant cities for current view
- **Better navigation**: Easier to find cities you can see on the map
- **Context-aware**: List always matches what's visible
- **Performance**: No need to scroll through hundreds of cities

### For the System ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Efficient rendering**: Only render cities in viewport
- **Smart filtering**: Uses memoization to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Real-time sync**: Map and sidebar stay perfectly synchronized
- **Scalable**: Works efficiently even with large numbers of cities

## Console Logging

The system provides detailed debug information:

```
üó∫Ô∏è Filtering cities within map bounds: {north: 49.38, south: 24.52, east: -66.93, west: -124.73}
‚úÖ City in viewport: New York (40.7128, -74.0060)
‚úÖ City in viewport: Los Angeles (34.0522, -118.2437)
üìç Showing 47 of 156 cities in current viewport
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Basic Filtering:**
   - Search for "United States"
   - Observe cities list shows "(X in view)"
   - Zoom in to a specific state
   - Notice the list updates with fewer cities

2. **Test Real-time Updates:**
   - Search for any country
   - Pan around the map
   - Watch the cities list update dynamically
   - Count should change as you move

3. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Zoom out very far - might show "No cities in current viewport"
   - Zoom in very close - might show only 1-2 cities
   - Pan outside country boundaries - should show 0 cities

4. **Test Performance:**
   - Search for large countries (USA, Russia, China)
   - Pan and zoom rapidly
   - List should update smoothly without lag

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Visual indicators**: Highlight visible cities on the map
2. **Cluster mode**: Group nearby cities when zoomed out
3. **Distance sorting**: Sort cities by distance from viewport center
4. **Auto-pan**: Click a city to automatically center map on it
5. **Bookmark viewports**: Save favorite map views

## Technical Notes

- Uses Leaflet's `getBounds()` API for accurate viewport calculation
- Filtering happens client-side for instant response
- No additional API calls needed - works with existing city data
- Compatible with all screen sizes and zoom levels
- Memory efficient - only filters, doesn't duplicate data
